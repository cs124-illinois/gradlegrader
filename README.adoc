= https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/[CS 125] Gradle Grading Plugin

This Gradle plugin attempts to enable local autograding for Java-based
assignments. This is non-trivial to accomplish, mainly because of the way that
Gradle works. But this is a decent attempt. It should work for other Java-based
assignments.

== Features

* Highly-configurable build and grading logic
* Declarative grading and scoring configuration requires no additional code for
  simple use cases
* Parses output from TestNG, `checkstyle`, and (probably) JUnit to assign points
* Can force students to identify themselves through a text file, to both help
  track progress and eliminate problems downstream
* Pretty-printed output to standard out for student inspection
* Multiple reporting options for structured data, including local file dump and
  remote POST

== Use

You will need to add something like this to your `build.gradle` file, where
`CURRENT_VERSION` is the version that you want to use. I believe that this has
to come _after_ you apply the Java and `checkstyle` plugins footnote:[Gradle
has stupid ordering dependencies in the configuration file.].

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit:4.10.0.201712302008-r'
        classpath 'com.github.cs125-illinois:gradle:CURRENT_VERSION'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'edu.illinois.cs.cs125.grade'
----

This will create a `grade` task with a number of options that are covered below.
Note that we build a fat JAR with most dependecies included, but jGit insists on
being signed and so has to be installed separately.

== Example

The grading task is configured through a YAML configuration file that, by
default, lives in `config/grade.yaml`, although you can change this in the
`build.gradle` file. Here is an example:

[source,yaml]
----

vcs:
  git: true
students:
  location: email.txt
  require: true
  suffix: "@illinois.edu"
files:

notes:
  "Note that the maximum local grade is 90/100. 10 points will be provided
  during official grading if you have committed code that earns at least 50
  points by Monday 10/30/2017 at 5PM."

      score: 10

      name: "checkstyle"
    - selector: "count(//file/error) > 0"
      score: 0
      message: "checkstyle errors were reported"
      name: "checkstyle"

  name: "testNG Tests"
  selectors:
    - selector: "count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']) = 1 and count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']//failure) = 0"
      score: 30
      message: "No test failures in FactorialTest"
      name: "FactorialTest"
    - selector: "count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']) = 1 and count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']//failure) = 1"
      score: 20
      message: "Test failures in FactorialTest"
      name: "FactorialTest"
    - selector: "count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']) = 1 and count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']//failure) > 1"
      score: 10
      message: "Test failures in FactorialTest"
      name: "FactorialTest"
    - selector: "count(//testsuite[@name='FactorialTest']) = 0"
      score: 0
      message: "FactorialTest didn't compile"
      name: "FactorialTest"
----

Assuming `src/main/java/Factorial.java` contains compiling but incorrect
student-written code in a Git repository configured to push to GitHub, and
`src/test/java/FactorialTest.java` contains TestNG test suites, `./gradlew
grade` could print the following:

----

locally or post it to an API endpoint:

(Note that I've removed the `testXML` property for succinctness.)

== Configuration

I'll briefly try to document the various configuration properties:

=== `config.name`

Simply copied to the output. Useful for identifying different assignments.

=== `config.vcs`

Configures whether the plugin will attempt to extract information about the
student's repository. Currently `git` is the only supported option. If set to
true, information similar to what is printed above will be displayed, including
configured remotes, user information, and the current head commit.

We could add more here. However, this information isn't necessarily that useful
for identifying students, since they may not set their email to their university
address, and it may be hard to identify them based on their repository URL.

=== `config.students`

Configures whether identifying information is required in project before the
autograder will run, where it lives and formatting details.

Using the information collected by this plugin requires being able to identify
students. A straightforward way to do this is to have them create (or edit) a
file in the project and add their university email address. If
`config.students.require` is set to true, this information is required before
the autograder will work. That's probably a pretty good incentive.

`config.students.location` specifies the path (relative to the project root)
that we load to find their email address. Right now we support text files with
one student email address per line. Email addresses are checked for validity
and, if `config.students.suffix` is set, we also check that they have the right
hostname. This is intended to prevent students from adding Gmail addresses, or
other email addresses that don't double as campus identifiers.

=== `config.files`

Specifies which files to compile.

Yes: you could just depend on the normal Gradle Java compilation task. But,
unfortunately, it fails the entire build if _anything_ fails to compile. Do you
want to give partial credit? Then we need this so that we can generate
individual compilation tasks that don't all depend on each other.

This is also what generates the current deprecation warning. I don't really know
how to fix this for Gradle 5.0, but the right thing might be to just ditch
Gradle entirely. It's proven a lot more troublesome to work with than I had
expected.

If a list of files is provided, the grader assumes that `File.java` is tested by
`FileTest.java`. If that is not true, or if there is not a one-to-one
relationship between your main and test files, you can use a different syntax:

[source,yaml]
----
files:
  - compile:
    - "ConnectN.java"
    - "Player.java"
    test: ConnectN
----

This specifies which files to compile and the root of the test file, which is
then appended with `Test`. So this would compile `ConnectNTest.java` and run the
test suites that it contains. So I guess you do have to have test files that end
with `Test`. Sorry.

=== `config.notes`

Grading notes that are printed after the scoring output. We use these in cases
where the autograder can't calculate all of the student's points, as in the
example above.

=== `config.secure`

A security policy used during secure grading, which can be enabled with the
`-Pgrade.secure` flag described below.

=== `canfig.reporting`

The grading plugin can return results in two ways: either by saving them to a
local file, or by posting them to a remote endpoint. The former is great for
secure official grading, the latter for tracking student progress remotely and
in-between commits.

`config.reporting.file` specifies the file location as a relative path.
`config.reporting.post` specifies the remote API endpoint. If only one is
specified, it will be used as the default. Or you can set
`config.reporting.default` to either `file` or `post`. If you want to disable
reporting, just omit this section entirely.

These values can also be overridden using command line options, as described
below.

=== `canfig.checkstyle`

This is the first of the grading sections. Both it and the `testng` section
described below have a similar format. At this point the name property isn't
used, but it could be used as a header in the output provided to students.
`missing` describes what to do if this information is missing during the build,
which would indicate that `checkstyle` crashed (this can happen).

The `selectors` property is the most important. The grading plugin takes the XML
produced by the `checkstyle` run and applies each `selector` to it in turn. If
the query matches, that selector is preserved in the output, shown to students,
and used in the total score calculation. More about selectors below.

Note that the grading plugin just runs the `checkstyle` task, but it doesn't
configure it. That's up to you in your `build.gradle`. Here's an example:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'checkstyle'
...
checkstyle {
    toolVersion "8.7"
}
----

=== `config.test`

Selectors for processing TestNG output. Note that the grading plugin takes _all_
TestNG output and combines it into a single XML file to simplify applying
selectors. The single file has a `<testsuites>` tag that all `<testsuite>`
results are added to.

Similar to the `checkstyle` section above, all matching selectors are preserved
in the output.

At present this plugin is only used with TestNG, but I believe that JUnit also
generates similar XML and could probably be used as well. Maybe with a bit of
fiddling footnote:[Everything involving Gradle requires fiddling.].

== Writing Selectors

A large part of using this plugin properly comes down to writing good XPath
selectors for the `checkstyle` and `test` components footnote:[Yes, XPath is
awful, but everything from the Java era seems to love to generate XML. So what
are you going to do?].

Testing your selectors is probably the most important piece of advice. But also
keep in mind that you probably have groups of selectors where only one should
match. We could probably support this better in a future version of this plugin,
but for now it's up to you to ensure that given a group of N selectors, _one and
only one_ matches any given output. Test your selectors carefully, and expect to
have to add a lot of duplicative conditional logic.

[[command]]
== Command Line Options

Our grading plugin reads several properties from the global Gradle properties
object, all prefixed with `grade`.

[[command-capture]]
=== `-Pgrade.capture`: Capture Grading Output

Enables the collection of all testing output that would normally be printed to
the display. Actually, it's also printed, and a wraparound tool can probably do
a better job of collecting it and separating standard output and error---but
this is here if you want it. Output ends up as the `output` property on the
output JSON object.

[[command-secure]]
=== `-Pgrade.secure`: Enable Secure Grading

If this is set, the JVM will be configured to use the security policy that you
specify in your configuration file (`config.secure`) when tests are run.

I _strongly_ suggest using the excellent
https://github.com/pro-grade/pro-grade[pro-grade] library to write your security
policies. That allows you to use deny syntax, which simplifies
highly-restrictive policies. To use pro-grade, you need the following in your
`build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    testRuntime 'net.sourceforge.pro-grade:pro-grade:1.1.1'
}
----

Then you can write policies like this one. This is a good example of a
highly-restrictive policy for safe grading of untrusted student code, which
provides only access to files in the resources directory:

[source]
----
priority "grant";
// From https://github.com/pro-grade/pro-grade/issues/31
deny codeBase "file:${main.sources}/-" {
  permission java.io.FilePermission "<<ALL FILES>>", "read, write, execute";
  permission java.net.NetPermission "*";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "createClassLoader";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessClassInPackage.sun";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "setSecurityManager";
  permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "setPolicy";
  permission java.security.SecurityPermission "setProperty.package.access";
};
grant codeBase "file:${main.sources}/-" {
  permission java.io.FilePermission "${main.resources}/-", "read";
};
----

If you see error messages like this during secure grading:

[source]
----
Policy policy.url.2=file:/Users/challen/.java.policy wasn't successfully parsed.
Exception message: /Users/challen/.java.policy (No such file or directory)
----

just create an empty file in the requested location and they'll go away.

=== `-Pgrade.reporting`: Change Reporting Options

We use the grading plugin both to enable continuous local student-facing
autograding, and during official grading. In the first case, we want to push the
results to an API endpoint. In the latter, we want to save them locally. So the
plugin has command-line options to change the reporting location.

If `-Pgrade.reporting` is set, it will change the default reporting location to
either `post` or `file`. If `-Pgrade.reporting.file` is set, it both sets the
location of the output file _and_ sets reporting to the file option.

=== Example Secure Official Command Line Options

As stated above, we use this plugin both to provide students with a local
autograder and during official grading. During official grading, we both want to
secure the testing environment and generate structured data, which is then
processed further by driver scripts and eventually lands in a database.

To simplify things, the default configuration is set up for local autograding:
security is disabled, and results are reporting to our API endpoint. That allows
us to create a run configuration in IntelliJ that just runs the `grade` task and
does the right thing without further configuration.

During secure grading we use the command line options as follows to set up
things properly:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew -Pgrade.capture -Pgrade.secure -Pgrade.reporting.file=../grade.json
----

You could store the grading output in the same directory, but we export student
code into a subdirectory of a temporary directory and so save it one level up.

== Possible TODOs

* Better student email address validation, perhaps checking against a remote API
to ensure that they are in fact in the class. At least a small fraction of the
class will not type their email address correctly, causing confusion and
problems.
* Work around Windows firewall issues. I have seen the plugin be blocked, at
which point we don't get any data. Not sure how to distinguish this from the
case when we're just offline, since we do want students to be able to work
without internet access.
