= https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/[CS 125] Gradle Grading Plugin

This Gradle plugin provides autograding for Java-based assignments.

== Features

* Parses output from JUnit-compatible test tasks and `checkstyle`
* Assigns test case point values from annotations
* Manufactures needed Gradle tasks to help reduce build script size
* Pretty-printed output to standard out for student inspection
* Multiple reporting options for resulting JSON, including local file dump and remote POST
* Can require students to commit their work after earning more points
* Supports Android modules tested by link:http://robolectric.org/[Robolectric]
* Compatible with Gradle 5+

== Installing

GradleGrader is available from Maven Central. To apply the Gradle plugin, add something
like this to the project you need to grade, or to the root project if you're grading multiple
subprojects:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.cs125-illinois:gradlegrader:2020.1.3'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'edu.illinois.cs.cs125.gradlegrader'

gradlegrader {
    // Grading configuration goes here - see the Configuring section below
}
----

To allow using GradleGrader annotations in test suites, add the same package as
a dependency to the project(s) containing graded test suites:

    testImplementation 'com.github.cs125-illinois:gradlegrader:2020.1.3'

To apply the test dependency to all subprojects, add that to a `subprojects` &rarr;
`afterEvaluate` &rarr; `dependencies` block in the root project's build script.

If you are using a Kotlin build script or would like to use the new `plugins` block
to apply the plugin, you will need to fill in the settings script (`settings.gradle`)
to tell Gradle where to find our artifact:

[source,kotlin]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachPlugin {
            if (requested.id.namespace == "edu.illinois.cs.cs125" && requested.version != null) {
                useModule("com.github.cs125-illinois:${requested.id.name}:${requested.version}")
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== Writing Tests

To mark a test case as graded, add the `@Graded` annotation on the test method
and specify the point value with the `points` property.
The optional `friendlyName` property sets the description of the test case in the
report.

You can use the (repeatable) `@Tag` annotation to add tags to tests, which will be
added to their result object in the output JSON. The `name` property becomes the JSON
property name; the `value` property becomes the (string) value.

== Configuring

All other configuration goes in the `gradlegrader` block in the Gradle script.
That block has the following properties:

* `assignment` (optional) is the string ID of the assignment in your system.
  It produces an `assignment` property on the result JSON object.
* `captureOutput` (default false) sets whether to record the textual output of
  the `checkstyle`, compile, and test tasks. The output is combined and written to the
  `output` property of the final JSON object.
* `forceClean` (default true) sets whether to clean all graded subprojects before grading,
  i.e. require a completely fresh compilation.
* `keepDaemon` (default true) sets whether to leave the Gradle daemon running after the
  grade task completes. Setting this to false (i.e. killing the Gradle process) helps
  suppress Gradle spew but produces an IDE warning the first time, which may alarm students.
* `maxPoints` (optional) sets an overall points cap.
* `subprojects` (optional) sets the list of Gradle projects to grade. Each must have a `test`
  or `testDebugUnitTest` task. If this property is not specified, only the project to which
  the plugin is applied is graded.

The `systemProperty` function takes a name and value (both strings) to pass to the test
JVM(s) as a Java system property (`-D`). The function can be used multiple times to add multiple
system properties. To skip applying custom system properties, run the grade task with the
`-Pgrade.ignoreproperties` command-line option.

`gradlegrader` also contains several blocks.

=== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `checkpoint`

This block allows you to manipulate test takes so that you can grade one "checkpoint" of a
large project at a time.

* `yamlFile` (required to enable checkpointing) is a `File` that specifies where to find the
  student's checkpoint selection. This file must have at least a `checkpoint` property.
* `testConfigureAction` (default no-op) is a `BiConsumer` that will be called for each test task,
  passed the currently selected checkpoint name and a test task to configure with it. You could
  use this to apply a test name include pattern based on the current checkpoint, for example.

You can also specify the test configuration action by passing an action/closure to the
`configureTests` function.

=== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `checkstyle`

This block sets the `checkstyle` grading options. You must also apply the `checkstyle` plugin
if you use `checkstyle` integration.

* `configFile` (required if this block is present) is the `File` representing the `checkstyle`
  rules XML file.
* `exclude` (defaults to `+++**/gen/**+++`, `+++**/R.java+++`, `+++**/BuildConfig.java+++`)
  is the list of file patterns to exclude from style checks.
* `include` (defaults to `+++**/*.java+++`) is the list of file patterns to check for style.
* `points` is the number of points earned for the absence of `checkstyle` violations.
* `version` (defaults to `8.18`) is the `checkstyle` tool version to use.

=== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `identification`

This block sets the student identification policy.

* `txtFile` (required if this block is present) is the `File` that students need to fill out
  with their identities. If there are multiple students working on the project, this file should
  have one identifier per line.
* `validate` (defaults to always-true) is a `Spec` that each student identifier must pass.
  To require university email addresses, you can use
  `{ email +++->+++ email.endsWith('@university.edu') }`.
* `countLimit` (defaults to must-be-one) is a `Spec` that the number of provided student identifiers
  must pass.
* `message` (optional) is a string to specify a custom error message for invalid contributor formats
  or counts.

=== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `reporting`

This block sets the grade reporting settings.

* `jsonFile` (optional) is the `File` where a JSON report will be saved.
* `printJson` (default false) sets whether the grade task will print the JSON result to
  standard output.

The `tag` function takes a name (string) and value (string or integer) and produces a property
on the report JSON object.

==== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `reporting` &rarr; `post`

This block configures a POST request that submits the JSON report.

* `endpoint` (required if this block is present) sets the URL to make the request to.

The `includeFiles` function sets a list of `Files` (or a file collection) to be read and included
in a `files` object on the POST JSON report. That information is not included in the local report.

**A simple report logging server is included in this repository.**
See the Reporting Server section below for how to configure it.

==== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `reporting` &rarr; `printPretty`

This block configures the pretty grade report table printed to standard output for student
inspection.

* `enabled` (default true) sets whether the pretty-printed table is shown.
* `notes` (optional) is the extra text to show below the grade report. This will be automatically
  word-wrapped to the appropriate width unless you add newlines yourself.
* `showTotal` (default true) sets whether the total score row is displayed.
* `title` (optional) sets a caption at the top of the table.

=== `gradlegrader` &rarr; `vcs`

This block enables VCS (currently only Git) integration.

* `git` (default false) enables Git integration, adding information about the student's Git
  repository and identity to a `git` object on the JSON report.
* `requireCommit` (default false) requires students to commit their changes after their score
  increases. When this is enabled and the student's best score increases, a note about committing
  is included in the pretty-printed table (if enabled) and the grade task will refuse to run
  again until the changes are committed. If checkpointing is enabled, checkpoint-specific best
  scores will be maintained.

== Example

This is an example GradleGrader configuration block for an Android project with two modules:

[source, groovy]
----
gradlegrader {
    assignment 'Spring2019.MP0'
    checkstyle {
        points = 10
        configFile = file('config/checkstyle.xml')
    }
    identification {
        txtFile = file('email.txt')
        validate = { email -> email.endsWith('@example.edu') }
    }
    reporting {
        jsonFile = file('grade.json')
        post {
            endpoint = "https://example.com/progress"
        }
        printPretty {
            title = "MP0: Location"
            notes = "Note that the maximum local grade is 90/100. 10 points will be awarded during " +
                    "official grading if you have submitted code that earns at least 40 points by " +
                    "Monday, May 20."
        }
    }
    subprojects project(':app'), project(':lib')
    vcs {
        git = true
        requireCommit = true
    }
}
----

It has JUnit test suites with methods declared like this:

[source, java]
----
@Test(timeout = 300)
@Graded(points = 10)
@Tag(name = "difficulty", value = "simple")
@Tag(name = "function", value = "beenHere")
public void testBeenHereSimple() {
    // tests the student's beenHere function
}
----

If the student has an `app` module that fails to compile and a `lib` module that is partially correct,
the human-readable output may look like this:

----
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MP0: Location
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiler                       0    app didn't compile
testFarthestNorthRandom        10   testFarthestNorthRandom passed
testFarthestNorthSimple        0    testFarthestNorthSimple failed
testNextRandomLocationRandom   10   testNextRandomLocationRandom passed
testNextRandomLocationSimple   10   testNextRandomLocationSimple passed
testBeenHereRandom             10   testBeenHereRandom passed
testBeenHereSimple             10   testBeenHereSimple passed
checkstyle                     0    checkstyle found style issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                          50
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the maximum local grade is 90/100. 10 points will be awarded during
official grading if you have submitted code that earns at least 40 points by
Monday, May 20.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

The JSON report may look like this:

----

All possible JSON properties are described below.

== Output Format

The root JSON object has these properties:

* `pointsEarned` is the total number of points the submission earned, capped if directed
  by the `maxPoints` configuration property.
* `pointsPossible` is the total number of points available in all scored components.
* `assignment` is the value of the `assignment` configuration property or null if that property
  is not specified.
* `checkpoint` is the current checkpoint name from the student's checkpoint selection
  YAML file, if checkpointing is enabled.
* `output` is the textual output from the `checkstyle`, compilation, and test tasks, if
  the `captureOutput` configuration property is true.
* `contributors` is an array of identifiers, if identification is enabled in the configuration.

Tags created by the `tag` directive in the `reporting` block appear as properties
(with either string or integer values).

=== `modules`

This property is an array of objects, one for each tested module/subproject.
Each object has these properties:

* `name` is the name of the Gradle subproject.
* `compiled` is whether any test results could be found for that module.

=== `scores`

This property is an array of objects, one for each scoring component
(i.e. one line in the human-readable table report). Each object has these properties:

* `description` is a short summary of the item (shown on the left in the human-readable table):
  ** "Compiler" if the item notes a module's failure to compile
  ** "checkstyle" for the checkstyle report
  ** The test method name, or friendly name if set in `@Graded`, for test methods
* `explanation` is an explanation of why credit was or was not given (shown on the right in
  the human-readable table).
* `pointsPossible` is the number of points possible to earn from this item.
* `pointsEarned` is number of points earned: all points possible if the check/test succeeded,
  or zero if failed.
* `type` identifies what kind of item this is: `compileError`, `checkstyle`, or `test`.

`compileError` items have this additional property:

* `module` is the name of the Gradle subproject that failed to compile.

`checkstyle` items have these additional properties:

* `ran` is whether `checkstyle` processed the sources without crashing and generated a report.
* `passed` is whether the report indicated no style violations.

`test` items have these additional properties:

* `module` is the name of the Gradle subproject containing this test.
* `className` is the fully-qualified Java class name of the test suite.
* `testCase` is the test method name.
* `passed` is whether the test completed successfully.
* `failureStackTrace` is the stack trace of the exception that caused the test case to fail,
  if `passed` is false.

Tags created by `@Tag` annotations on test methods appear as additional properties
with string values.

=== `git`

This property, present only if Git integration is enabled, is an object with these properties:

* `remotes` is an object with a property for each Git remote. The property name is the
  remote ID; the value is the URL.
* `user` is an object with these properties:
  ** `name` is the Git user name.
  ** `email` is the Git email address (which is not necessarily an organization address).
* `head` is the hash of the `HEAD` commit.

=== `files`

This property, present only in the POST report and only if there are any `includeFiles`
configuration directives, is an array with an object for each included file.
Each object has these properties:

* `name` is the unqualified file name.
* `path` is the full path of the file.
* `data` is the textual content of the file, if it could be read.

== Reporting Server

The `server` module in this repository is a simple web server that logs POST reports
into a MongoDB database. Before storing the POSTed document, it adds these properties:

* `receivedVersion` (string) is the current reporting server version
* `receivedTime` (date/time) is the time the report was received
* `receivedIP` (string) is the IP of the host submitting the POST report
* `receivedSemester` (string) is the configured semester

The server can be configured with environment variables or a `config.yaml` file from
the working directory of the application. It has these configuration options:

* `mongo` (required) is the MongoDB connection string.
* `mongoCollection` (default `gradlegrader`) is the MongoDB collection to save
  reports in.
* `http` (default `http://0.0.0.0:8888`) is the host and port to listen on.
* `semester` (optional) is the semester to tag reports with.

A Docker container can be set up using the `Dockerfile` in the `server` module.
